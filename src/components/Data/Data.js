        "author" : "Stephen G. Kochan",
        "description" : "The book starts off by explaining the ideas of compilation, linking and so on but without referring to any particular implementation. Chapter 2 gets you off the blocks with a first program - which is hello world in disguise as it prints \"programming is fun\". The example makes use of gcc to compile and link and there is very little help given if you want to use some other compiler or an IDE. You can more or less say that the book leaves it mostly up to you to workout and setup your C environment which makes things fairly easy for Linux users but not so easy for the beginner working with any other operating system.",

        "description" : "HTML5 and CSS3 are important but there is a problem for any book covering them. Do you simply deal with the new elements of do you start at the beginning and explain the technology from scratch? If you do go cover the basics you have a book that the beginner might get something from, but you will also annoy the expert who is expecting a book just on the new aspects of HTM5 etc.\nThis particular book starts from the beginning and attempts to teach HTML and CSS. The big problem is that it really doesn't go out of its way to explain things in a modern style.",

        "description" : "It consists of just 16 pages of nice sayings that have positive messages, printed in bright colours and in well-formed HTML.\n\"It's never too early to be standards compliant! Show your little ones HTML markup code along with letter forms to get them started on the visual patterns and symbols that make up the essential building blocks of the Web.\"\nIf you know a baby who needs inspiring from the cradle onwards to code properly rather than lazily using a GUI editor, this would make an excellent present. It could also be an excellent way to annoy a colleague whose HTML coding abilities fall below your own high standards.",

        "author" : "Peter Elst, Charles Brown & Nathalie",
        "description" : "HTML5 solutions is a formulaic book in the sense that it presents \"solutions\" in a set format, even if the format doesn't quite suit a topic. The sections included in each solution are: What's involved, How to build it and Expert tips  In many cases one or more of the sections isn't really needed. This format makes more like a programming recipe cookbook than anything else - only HTML5 isn't really programming.",

        "author" : "Jason Lengstorf & Phil Leggetter",
        "description" : "The subtitle of this book is \"With HTML5 WebSocket, PHP\", and jQuery which gives you a good idea of the sort of thing the book is about. It certainly isn't about WebRTC or any other more \"up-market\" forms of realtime media and communications. This is essentially about establishing a two-way data exchange between the client and the server.\nThis is the sort of thing that techniques such as long polling and HTTP streaming were invented to do. If you don't know what these are, don't worry because chapter 1 does a good job of explaining the idea of each of them. It then moves on to consider its proposed solution - WebSockets. The general idea is explained and detail is given down to the protocol used. However, no explanation of using the API is provided.",

        "author" : "Ric Shreves",
        "description" : "This is a promising book if you want to find out how to use the Joomla! CMS (content management system) - mainly because it has a colourful cover and is very thick. Once you get inside the presentation is slow, steady and clear with a scattering of boxes to add information to the basic text. It starts off from what Joomla is, through installation, to using and even customising it.It is undeniably comprehensive in that it more or less goes through each of the Joomla menu options and explains each one. The big problem is that the explanations are mostly vacuous and add nothing to your understanding.",
